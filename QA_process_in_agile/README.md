# QA Process

Be it a service based company or a product based company, at the end of the day company's goal is to deliver services/products to the customer and we as a team work on those deliverables. Now, to get a quality product, it is necessary for a company to have a quality process in place. If the process is good, output product will be of good quality.

## Quality Assurance vs Quality Control

As a tester when we are testing a component or a system, we are testing a work product and this comes under the definition of Quality Control. But as **testing** is itself a process not a standalone activity, in this view Quality Assurance assists Quality control.

### What is testing?

There is a misconception that testing is just executing the test cases. Although execution is the activity in which bulk of a tester's effort is put into but it is not the only activity and certainly not the first activity. Testing begins with **Test planning**. There are pre-execution test activites as well as post-execution test activities. So, now that we have talked about what testing is not, let's define what testing is,

#### Testing is:
- to determine that work product confirms with the specified requirements
- to validate that the product built is fit for purpose and
- to detect defects.

## QA Process in Agile

- Be involved in backlog planning/user-story refinement sessions.
- As soon as the ticket comes on board from backlog, perform requirement analysis and start writing test cases.
- Send test cases for review to business.
- Incorporate feedback, if any
- When the ticket comes IN QA, execute test cases and
    - in case you have observations, compile your observations and confirm with BA if they should be raised as bug
    - else provide sign off on the requirement/user-story.
- Update the QA Progress in DSM.
- Be involved in retrospectives and provide your input to improve the QA Process.
